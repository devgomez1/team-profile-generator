# TEAM PROFILE GENERATOR

## Description


This Challenge saw for me to write a command line application that takes user input about a team of employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays information for each person. For this challenge one must install Inquirer and Jest (to run your tests).


## Acceptance Critera 

```
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
```

## Installation

After cloning the code one will need to install npm, inquirer, Jest. Then simply run the js file using "node index.js" and answer the questions, after this they will be presented with the HTML page.

## Usage
